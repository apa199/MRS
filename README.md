<h1>Movie Recomendation System:</h1>
<h2>Summary:</h2> This is a movie recomendation system which is making use of the CountVectorizer to make the data into vector.
After the vectorization cosine_similarity score to evaluate the simalarity of words and then accurately recommend the most 5 similar movies to the user based on the title of the movie which the user gives as an input to the system.

There are basically three types of recommender systems:-

Demographic Filtering- They offer generalized recommendations to every user, based on movie popularity and/or genre. The System recommends the same movies to users with similar demographic features. Since each user is different , this approach is considered to be too simple. The basic idea behind this system is that movies that are more popular and critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience.
Content Based Filtering- They suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it.
Collaborative Filtering- This system matches persons with similar interests and provides recommendations based on this matching. Collaborative filters do not require item metadata like its content-based counterparts.

In this project I have used Collaborative Filtering.
Going Forward with the help of streamlit library I have made a web application below is some Sample Screen shot
